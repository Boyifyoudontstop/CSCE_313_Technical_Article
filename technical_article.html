  <h4 id="Section1.1"> 1.1 Why your Hardware Matters </h4>

    <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">	In terms of computer and information security, hardware-base security is the preferred route over software-base security. It is tried and tested to provide stronger and more dependable security measures that have a resistance to malware and other malicious software attacks that would tamper with the system. Cryptography methods done at the hardware level, such as those done by hardware security modules and physically unclonable functions, are able to function with greater efficiency as the algorithms can be better optimized with the hardware performance. This higher performance is also physically protected rather than simply software protected from unauthorized access of private data and fills in the gaps of the defensive wall. An advantage of having a dedicated hardware security unit is the ability to physically separate encryption functions into a differing crypto algorithm processor as it becomes more difficult for outside tampering and interception of information to occur. Software security can and does play its role in its cryptography of the information, however a sole software based security would have its data running in the same location as the rest of the processes resulting in outside source having a greater effect compared to a separate physical entity.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;"> A key component of hardware security that Albert Jeng discusses is how more recent computing devices under 5G and IoT/AIoT have become unsupervised and physically exposed. Software security simply cannot combat attacks done to the physical components of these devices, thus hardware security and its implementation is more important than ever. Overall, hardware security enforces a separate secure storage and self managed memory space that works as a buffer for tampering and data breaches of private system information needed for encryption. Notably, these implementations require specific hardware components and design features that need to be able to communicate with the operating system. If the operating system is unable to take advantage of the features hardware security provides, then it is meaningless to provide those hardware upgrades. This lack of flexibility is admittedly a major downside to hardware security as many popular instruction set architectures within current day processors are unlikely to change their own “good enough” designs and mindset to fit the wants of experimenting consumers. This hardware limitation however may be a thing of the past as RISCV, with its open source format, can provide a resource that can eliminate some disadvantages of hardware security.
    </p>

  <h4 id="Section1.2">1.2 Why your Operating System Matters</h4>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;"> One important factor to consider when choosing an operating system is whether it is open source or closed source. Closed source operating systems, such as Windows OS, are proprietary and do not allow users to access or modify the source code. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for users to fully understand what the operating system is doing on their computer. For example, Windows OS constantly scans a user's computer for updates and potentially unwanted programs, which can raise privacy concerns for some users. Furthermore, this low accessibility puts users in a closed box that limits much of their problem solving potential and are forced to either switch platforms or succumb to sitting in the passenger seat of their own system.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;"> In contrast, open source operating systems, such as Linux, allow users to access and modify the source code. This transparency can provide users with greater control over their computing experience and increased privacy. Because the source code is freely available, users can review it to ensure that there are no hidden vulnerabilities or backdoors. Additionally, open source operating systems are often free to use and distribute, which can be especially beneficial for individuals and organizations with limited resources.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;"> When selecting an operating system, it is also important to consider the specific needs of the user. The decision should focus on how a system can give an advantageous hand rather than hinder the available options. For example, if a user primarily uses their computer for gaming, they may want to choose an operating system that is optimized for gaming performance and the ability to push the boundaries of a standard computer on their terms. On the other hand, if a user prioritizes security and privacy, they may want to choose an open source operating system with strong encryption and security features. Additionally, the open source feature would allow a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the system and the user could fully benefit from the complete design.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;"> Ultimately, the choice of operating system can have significant implications for a user's productivity, privacy, and security. It is important for users to carefully evaluate their options and choose an operating system that aligns with their needs and values.
  </p>

  <h4 id="Section1.3">1.3 RISCV on Linux</h4>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">When combined with Linux, which is another open source operating system, RISC-V offers a powerful combination of flexibility and accessibility. Linux is a highly customizable and widely used operating system that provides a stable and secure platform for software development and deployment. When running on RISC-V processors, Linux offers increased performance and reduced power consumption, making it a great choice for a wide range of applications.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;"> Another significant advantage of using RISC-V with Linux is the added benefit of security. Because both RISC-V and Linux are open source, they are subject to constant scrutiny and improvement from a wide range of developers and security experts. This means that vulnerabilities can be identified and addressed quickly, and users can have greater confidence in the security of their systems. Additionally, RISC-V allows for the implementation of hardware-level security features, such as secure boot and encrypted memory, that can further enhance system security and overrides the previously mentioned limitations of hardware security. A user can have the freedom to physically upgrade their system and design software that can take full advantage of those upgrades. 
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;"> In summary, the combination of RISC-V and Linux offers a powerful and flexible platform for hardware and software development. Both platforms are open source, which allows for greater customization and accessibility, and also provides the added benefit of security through constant community scrutiny and improvement. As more and more developers and companies adopt RISC-V and Linux, we can expect to see even greater innovation and advancements in the world of computer hardware and software.

<h2 id="Section2" class="numbered">What is RISCV</h2>

  <h4 id="Section2.1"> 2.1 Conception </h4>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">RISCV originated at the University of California at Berkeley as part of an instruction set for the Parallel Computing Laboratory. While funded by DARPA, Intel, and Microsoft, the goal of the research was parallel processing systems. This allowed the creation of the ISA to be considered basic research, and open source under a Berkeley Software Distribution license. While the designation allows the US government to retain the rights to use the ISA as well as anything else developed in the research, it does not restrict the technology, allowing anyone to take part in this open source project. 
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">From their conception, Linux and RISCV share a lot of similar principles. One of these is the concept of open source design. Unlike the Windows operating system or x86 instruction set architecture, the source code for Linux distributions and RISCV cores are generally open source. According to senior security program manager Scott Christiansen in an article from theverge.com, “47,000 developers generate nearly 30,000 bugs a month (at Microsoft)”[1]. These bugs can be found either through consumers reporting them or the developers themselves. Either way, the source code must then be addressed by a developer, who in turn is responsible for fixing it. With an open source platform, anyone can easily report a bug, and more people can attempt to provide solutions for it.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">RISCV International is an organization founded in 2015 that serves as a community for people to collaborate and innovate the software and hardware around the RISCV instruction set architecture. In 2018, they announced a joint collaboration with the Linux Foundation, which has offered training, technical support, and legal expertise as a fellow open source project. In 2020, RISCV international became a legal entity when it was incorporated in Switzerland. This does not put the RISCV ISA under the ownership of RISCV international, but it does establish a legal basis for the organization. 
  </p>

  <h4 id="Section2.2">2.2 Production</h4>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">There is a considerable amount of work being done on RISCV cores. From Opentitan to Rocket core, these projects are being worked on all simultaneously by many contributors. A fascinating feature about these cores is that they are all open source. Online github repositories and active developers will take any fork or raised issue into consideration. Here are 20 RISCV cores, categorized based on their main utility.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">

</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">*Note that each core may contain multiple selling points and have multiple utilities.</p>
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">The growing popularity of RISCV cores is not only due to their versatility and open-source nature, but also their potential for enhanced hardware security. With the increasing number of cyberattacks and data breaches, hardware security has become a critical concern in the tech industry. Many of the RISCV cores mentioned above, such as Western Digital's SweRV EH1 Core and Esperanto's ET-Maxion Core, were specifically designed with security in mind, implementing features such as side-channel attack resistance and secure boot capabilities. In addition, the open-source nature of these cores allows for greater transparency and scrutiny, making it easier to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities. As RISCV continues to gain momentum, we can expect to see even more emphasis on hardware security in future designs, providing consumers with a safer and more reliable computing experience.
  </p>

  <h4 id="Section2.3">2.3 Future</h4>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">At the rate production is going, there will be many RISCV cores fabricated and openly available to purchase from multiple vendors. This will be great for the chip market for multiple reasons. For starters, it gives the consumer more options, which is always better from a price competitive standpoint. It also gives consumers a safe and open source option, meaning the source code and active development is being handled by people who are passionate about hardware design as opposed to a massive corporation or conglomerate. Finally, they can purchase a chip with a greater specialization or utility inherent in the design. </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">The future job opportunities include RISCV hardware and software developers, in the context of creating, fabricating, and maintaining systems based in RISCV. As the RISCV architecture gains more popularity and adoption, we can expect to see a significant increase in the number of companies offering RISCV-based products and services. This will not only create new business opportunities but also drive innovation in the industry, as more engineers and developers will be working on this new platform. This will likely result in a more diverse range of RISC V-based products, from low-power IoT devices to high-performance data center servers, and everything in between.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">One area where we can expect to see significant growth is in the development of RISC V-based embedded systems, especially in the fields of autonomous vehicles, robotics, and edge computing. As these industries continue to expand, the need for efficient and reliable processing solutions will only increase. RISCVs open-source and customizable nature makes it an attractive choice for developers in these fields, who require highly specialized hardware and software solutions.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">Moreover, with the advent of RISCV, we can expect to see a shift in the traditional way of thinking about hardware and software development. As more developers gain access to the RISCV platform, we will see a more collaborative and community-driven approach to building and maintaining software and hardware. This will lead to a more inclusive and diverse community, where people from all backgrounds and skill levels can contribute to the development of RISC V-based technologies, creating a more vibrant and dynamic industry.

<h2 id="Section4" class="numbered">4. Security</h2>

<h4 id="Section4.1"> 4.1 Examples in Hardware</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">	Hardware vulnerabilities can be more devastating than software vulnerabilities for multiple reasons. Not only is the problem at the lowest possible level, but patches or fixes must be done in software and come with serious slowdowns and drawbacks.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;"> With everyday appliances from your computer to the refrigerator having internet connections, data breaches are a valid concern as the network of connecting devices continues to grow and the need for security along with it. Software security cannot be left alone to handle possible vulnerabilities, and RISC-V based architecture is focused on having connected systems synonymous with security. Additions to physical security would take much of the load off devices’ processors and increase the intended performance of those appliances while also providing a separate layer of protection. Some of these physical additions include:
</p>

<ul style="font-size: 16px;">
  <li>4-Ring Trust: A hierarchy of privileges and access to resources that limits devices on the outer rings to those of more importance on the inside through separate secure physical key storages. This is very important to a household or business of interconnected devices, some with greater security priority than others.</li>
  <li>Device Unique Identity: Further keys for identification that are determined by the physical components of device that are unclonable and unforgeable.</li>
  <li>Secure Boot: Hardware components that only allow correct unaltered software to run, limits tampering of devices.</li>
  <li>Secure Storage: Key created are hardware bound, they cannot leave the separate security module and is a key feature to above implementations.</li>
  <li>Side-Channel Attack Prevention: Limits the ability to access hardware data through exploit of systems energy consumption.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;"> Overall, RISC-V brings many advantages to hardware security usage and its open box of opportunities gives users greater control over their security needs.
</p>

<h4 id="Section4.2">4.2 Examples in Software</h4>

<p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">While software vulnerabilities can be patched, they are more numerous and introduce different kinds of security issues. Hardware that is sold cannot be modified once it reaches the consumer, but software is constantly being updated and patched, allowing for more room for more errors. Here are some examples of common vulnerabilities: 
</p>

<ul style="font-size: 16px;">
  <li>Buffer Overflow: A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to store more data in a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to memory corruption and can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.</li>
  <li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious code into a website, potentially allowing them to steal user credentials or perform other malicious actions.</li>
  <li>SQL Injection: SQL Injection attacks occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious SQL code into a web application, allowing them to access or modify sensitive data.</li>
  <li>Remote Code Execution: Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a system, potentially allowing them to take control of the system or steal sensitive data.</li>
  <li>Denial of Service (DoS): A Denial of Service attack occurs when an attacker floods a system with traffic or requests, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.</li>
  <li>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: A Man-in-the-Middle attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, potentially allowing them to steal sensitive information or modify the communication.</li>
  <li>Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Zero-Day vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that are unknown to the public or software vendor, and are therefore unpatched. They can be exploited by attackers before a patch or fix is released, and can be very difficult to detect and defend against.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Summary"> 5. Summary </h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px; text-indent: 40px;">Overall, the combination of RISC-V and Linux has the potential to significantly enhance security and give users greater control over their hardware and software. The open-source nature of both RISC-V and Linux allows for greater transparency and the ability to customize and audit the code, which can help to identify and address security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of RISC-V processors with an MMU in conjunction with Linux can provide advanced memory protection and other security features. Ultimately, this combination empowers users to take control of their computing experience, which can help to improve security and privacy for everyone.

<p>All code has to be lowercase: This applies to HTML element names, attributes,
attribute values (unless <code>text/CDATA</code>), CSS selectors, properties, and property
values (with the exception of strings).</p>

<h3 id="General_Meta_Rules" class="numbered">General Meta Rules</h3>

<h4 id="Encoding" class="numbered">Encoding</h4>

<p>Use UTF-8 (no BOM).</p>

<p>Make sure your editor uses UTF-8 as character encoding, without a byte order
mark.</p>

<p>Specify the encoding in HTML templates and documents via <code>&lt;meta
charset="utf-8"&gt;</code>. Do not specify the encoding of style sheets as these assume
UTF-8.</p>

<p>(More on encodings and when and how to specify them can be found in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/">Handling character encodings in HTML and CSS</a>.)</p>

<h4 id="Comments" class="numbered">Comments</h4>

<p>Explain code as needed, where possible.</p>

<p>Use comments to explain code: What does it cover, what purpose does it serve,
why is respective solution used or preferred?</p>

<p>(This item is optional as it is not deemed a realistic expectation to always
demand fully documented code. Mileage may vary heavily for HTML and CSS code and
depends on the project’s complexity.)</p>

<h4 id="Action_Items" class="numbered">Action Items</h4>

<p>Mark todos and action items with <code>TODO</code>.</p>

<p>Highlight todos by using the keyword <code>TODO</code> only, not other common formats like
<code>@@</code>.</p>

<p>Append a contact (username or mailing list) in parentheses as with the format
<code>TODO(contact)</code>.</p>

<p>Append action items after a colon as in <code>TODO: action item</code>.</p>

</code></pre>

<h2 id="HTML" class="numbered">HTML</h2>

<h3 id="HTML_Style_Rules" class="numbered">HTML Style Rules</h3>

<h4 id="Document_Type" class="numbered">Document Type</h4>

<p>Use HTML5.</p>

<p>HTML5 (HTML syntax) is preferred for all HTML documents: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>(It’s recommended to use HTML, as <code>text/html</code>. Do not use XHTML. XHTML, as
<a href="https://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml"><code>application/xhtml+xml</code></a>, lacks both browser
and infrastructure support and offers less room for optimization than HTML.)</p>

<p>Although fine with HTML, do not close void elements, i.e. write <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, not <code>&lt;br
/&gt;</code>.</p>

<h4 id="HTML_Validity" class="numbered">HTML Validity</h4>

<p>Use valid HTML where possible.</p>

<p>Use valid HTML code unless that is not possible due to otherwise unattainable
performance goals regarding file size.</p>

<p> Use tools such as the
<a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">W3C HTML validator</a>
to test.</p>

<p>Using valid HTML is a measurable baseline quality attribute that contributes to
learning about technical requirements and constraints, and that ensures proper
HTML usage.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html bad">&lt;!-- Not recommended --&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;article&gt;This is only a test.

&lt;article&gt;This is only a test.&lt;/article&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Semantics" class="numbered">Semantics</h4>

<p>Use HTML according to its purpose.</p>

<p>Use elements (sometimes incorrectly called “tags”) for what they have been
created for. For example, use heading elements for headings, <code>p</code> elements for
paragraphs, <code>a</code> elements for anchors, etc.</p>

<p>Using HTML according to its purpose is important for accessibility, reuse, and
code efficiency reasons.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html bad">&lt;!-- Not recommended --&gt;
&lt;div onclick="goToRecommendations();"&gt;All recommendations&lt;/div&gt;

<pre><code class="language-html good">&lt;!-- Recommended --&gt;
&lt;a href="recommendations/"&gt;All recommendations&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Multimedia_Fallback" class="numbered">Multimedia Fallback</h4>

<p>Provide alternative contents for multimedia.</p>

<p>For multimedia, such as images, videos, animated objects via <code>canvas</code>, make sure
to offer alternative access. For images that means use of meaningful alternative
text (<code>alt</code>) and for video and audio transcripts and captions, if available.</p>

<p>Providing alternative contents is important for accessibility reasons: A blind
user has few cues to tell what an image is about without <code>@alt</code>, and other users
may have no way of understanding what video or audio contents are about either.</p>

<p>(For images whose <code>alt</code> attributes would introduce redundancy, and for images
whose purpose is purely decorative which you cannot immediately use CSS for, use
no alternative text, as in <code>alt=""</code>.)</p>

<pre><code class="language-html bad">&lt;!-- Not recommended --&gt;
&lt;img src="spreadsheet.png"&gt;

<pre><code class="language-html good">&lt;!-- Recommended --&gt;
&lt;img src="spreadsheet.png" alt="Spreadsheet screenshot."&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Separation_of_Concerns" class="numbered">Separation of Concerns</h4>

<p>Separate structure from presentation from behavior.</p>

<p>Strictly keep structure (markup), presentation (styling), and behavior
(scripting) apart, and try to keep the interaction between the three to an
absolute minimum.</p>

<p>That is, make sure documents and templates contain only HTML and HTML that is
solely serving structural purposes. Move everything presentational into style
sheets, and everything behavioral into scripts.</p>

<p>In addition, keep the contact area as small as possible by linking as few style
sheets and scripts as possible from documents and templates.</p>

<p>Separating structure from presentation from behavior is important for
maintenance reasons. It is always more expensive to change HTML documents and
templates than it is to update style sheets and scripts.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html bad">&lt;!-- Not recommended --&gt;

&lt;h1 style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;HTML sucks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read about this on a few sites but now I’m sure:
  &lt;u&gt;HTML is stupid!!1&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;center&gt;I can’t believe there’s no way to control the styling of
  my website without doing everything all over again!&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve read about this on a few sites but today I’m actually
  doing it: separating concerns and avoiding anything in the HTML of
  my website that is presentational.
&lt;p&gt;It’s awesome!
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Entity_References" class="numbered">Entity References</h4>

<p>Do not use entity references.</p>

<p>There is no need to use entity references like <code>&amp;mdash;</code>, <code>&amp;rdquo;</code>, or
<code>&amp;#x263a;</code>, assuming the same encoding (UTF-8) is used for files and editors as
well as among teams.</p>

<p>The only exceptions apply to characters with special meaning in HTML (like <code>&lt;</code>
and <code>&amp;</code>) as well as control or “invisible” characters (like no-break spaces).</p>

<pre><code class="language-html bad">&lt;!-- Not recommended --&gt;

</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-html good">&lt;!-- Recommended --&gt;
The currency symbol for the Euro is “€”.
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Optional_Tags" class="numbered">Optional Tags</h4>

<p>Omit optional tags (optional).</p>

<p>For file size optimization and scannability purposes, consider omitting optional
tags. The
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#syntax-tag-omission">HTML5 specification</a>
defines what tags can be omitted.</p>

<p>(This approach may require a grace period to be established as a wider guideline
as it’s significantly different from what web developers are typically taught.
For consistency and simplicity reasons it’s best served omitting all optional
tags, not just a selection.)</p>

<pre><code class="language-html bad">&lt;!-- Not recommended --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

</code></pre>

<h4 id="type_Attributes" class="numbered"><code>type</code> Attributes</h4>

<p>Omit <code>type</code> attributes for style sheets and scripts.</p>

<p>Do not use <code>type</code> attributes for style sheets (unless not using CSS) and scripts
(unless not using JavaScript).</p>

<p>Specifying <code>type</code> attributes in these contexts is not necessary as HTML5 implies
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/obsolete.html#attr-style-type"><code>text/css</code></a>
and
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#attr-script-type"><code>text/javascript</code></a>
as defaults. This can be safely done even for older browsers.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html bad">&lt;!-- Not recommended --&gt;

<pre><code class="language-html good">&lt;!-- Recommended --&gt;
&lt;script src="https://www.google.com/js/gweb/analytics/autotrack.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="id_Attributes" class="numbered"><code>id</code> Attributes</h4>

<p>Avoid unnecessary <code>id</code> attributes.</p>

<p>Prefer <code>class</code> attributes for styling and <code>data</code> attributes for scripting.</p>

<p>Where <code>id</code> attributes are strictly required, always include a hyphen in the
value to ensure it does not match the JavaScript identifier syntax, e.g. use
<code>user-profile</code> rather than just <code>profile</code> or <code>userProfile</code>.</p>

<p>When an element has an <code>id</code> attribute, browsers will make that available as a
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/window-object.html#named-access-on-the-window-object">named property on the global <code>window</code> prototype</a>,
which may cause unexpected behavior. While <code>id</code> attribute values containing a
hyphen are still available as property names, these cannot be referenced as
global JavaScript variables.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html bad">&lt;!-- Not recommended: `window.userProfile` will resolve to reference the &lt;div&gt; node --&gt;
&lt;div id="userProfile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-html good">&lt;!-- Recommended: `id` attribute is required and its value includes a hyphen --&gt;
&lt;div aria-describedby="user-profile"&gt;

  &lt;div id="user-profile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  …
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="HTML_Formatting_Rules" class="numbered">HTML Formatting Rules</h3>

<h4 id="General_Formatting" class="numbered">General Formatting</h4>

<p>Use a new line for every block, list, or table element, and indent every such
child element.</p>

<p>Independent of the styling of an element (as CSS allows elements to assume a
different role per <code>display</code> property), put every block, list, or table element
on a new line.</p>

<p>Also, indent them if they are child elements of a block, list, or table element.</p>

<p>(If you run into issues around whitespace between list items it’s acceptable to
put all <code>li</code> elements in one line. A linter is encouraged to throw a warning
instead of an error.)</p>

<pre><code class="language-html good">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space&lt;/em&gt;, the final frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</code></pre>

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$ 5.00
      &lt;td&gt;$ 4.50
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="HTML_Line-Wrapping" class="numbered">HTML Line-Wrapping</h4>

<p>Break long lines (optional).</p>

<p>While there is no column limit recommendation for HTML, you may consider
wrapping long lines if it significantly improves readability.</p>

<p>When line-wrapping, each continuation line should be indented at least 4
additional spaces from the original line to distinguish wrapped attributes from
child elements.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html good">&lt;button mat-icon-button color="primary" class="menu-button"
    (click)="openMenu()"&gt;
  &lt;mat-icon&gt;menu&lt;/mat-icon&gt;

</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-html good">&lt;button

  &lt;mat-icon&gt;menu&lt;/mat-icon&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="HTML_Quotation_Marks" class="numbered">HTML Quotation Marks</h4>

<p>When quoting attributes values, use double quotation marks.</p>

<p>Use double (<code>""</code>) rather than single quotation marks (<code>''</code>) around attribute
values.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html bad">&lt;!-- Not recommended --&gt;

</code></pre>

<h2 id="CSS" class="numbered">CSS</h2>

<h3 id="CSS_Style_Rules" class="numbered">CSS Style Rules</h3>

<h4 id="CSS_Validity" class="numbered">CSS Validity</h4>

<p>Use valid CSS where possible.</p>

<p>Unless dealing with CSS validator bugs or requiring proprietary syntax, use
valid CSS code.</p>

<p> Use tools such as the
<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS validator</a>
to test.</p>

<p>Using valid CSS is a measurable baseline quality attribute that allows to spot
CSS code that may not have any effect and can be removed, and that ensures
proper CSS usage.</p>

<h4 id="ID_and_Class_Naming" class="numbered">Class Naming</h4>

<p>Use meaningful or generic class names.</p>

<p>Instead of presentational or cryptic names, always use class names that reflect
the purpose of the element in question, or that are otherwise generic.</p>

<p>Names that are specific and reflect the purpose of the element should be
preferred as these are most understandable and the least likely to change.</p>

<p>Generic names are simply a fallback for elements that have no particular or no
meaning different from their siblings. They are typically needed as “helpers.”</p>

<p>Using functional or generic names reduces the probability of unnecessary
document or template changes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css bad">/* Not recommended: meaningless */
.yee-1901 {}

/* Not recommended: presentational */
.button-green {}
.clear {}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-css good">/* Recommended: specific */
.gallery {}
.login {}
.video {}

/* Recommended: generic */
.aux {}
.alt {}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="ID_and_Class_Name_Style" class="numbered">Class Name Style</h4>

<p>Use class names that are as short as possible but as long as necessary.</p>

<p>Try to convey what a class is about while being as brief as possible.</p>

<p>Using class names this way contributes to acceptable levels of understandability
and code efficiency.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css bad">/* Not recommended */
.navigation {}
.atr {}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-css good">/* Recommended */
.nav {}
.author {}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="ID_and_Class_Name_Delimiters" class="numbered">Class Name Delimiters</h4>

<p>Separate words in class names by a hyphen.</p>

<p>Do not concatenate words and abbreviations in selectors by any characters
(including none at all) other than hyphens, in order to improve understanding
and scannability.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css bad">/* Not recommended: does not separate the words “demo” and “image” */
.demoimage {}

/* Not recommended: uses underscore instead of hyphen */
.error_status {}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-css good">/* Recommended */
.video-id {}
.ads-sample {}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Prefixes" class="numbered">Prefixes</h4>

<p>Prefix selectors with an application-specific prefix (optional).</p>

<p>In large projects as well as for code that gets embedded in other projects or on
external sites use prefixes (as namespaces) for class names. Use short, unique
identifiers followed by a dash.</p>

<p>Using namespaces helps preventing naming conflicts and can make maintenance
easier, for example in search and replace operations.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css good">.adw-help {} /* AdWords */
.maia-note {} /* Maia */
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Type_Selectors" class="numbered">Type Selectors</h4>

<p>Avoid qualifying class names with type selectors.</p>

<p>Unless necessary (for example with helper classes), do not use element names in
conjunction with classes.</p>

<p>Avoiding unnecessary ancestor selectors is useful for
<a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/06/18/simplifying-css-selectors/">performance reasons</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css bad">/* Not recommended */
ul.example {}
div.error {}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-css good">/* Recommended */
.example {}
.error {}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="ID_Selectors" class="numbered">ID Selectors</h4>

<p>Avoid ID selectors.</p>

<p>ID attributes are expected to be unique across an entire page, which is
difficult to guarantee when a page contains many components worked on by many
different engineers. Class selectors should be preferred in all situations.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css bad">/* Not recommended */
#example {}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-css good">/* Recommended */
.example {}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Shorthand_Properties" class="numbered">Shorthand Properties</h4>

<p>Use shorthand properties where possible.</p>

<p>CSS offers a variety of
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#shorthand">shorthand</a>
properties (like <code>font</code>) that should be used whenever possible, even in cases
where only one value is explicitly set.</p>

<p>Using shorthand properties is useful for code efficiency and understandability.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css bad">/* Not recommended */
border-top-style: none;
font-family: palatino, georgia, serif;
font-size: 100%;
line-height: 1.6;
padding-bottom: 2em;
padding-left: 1em;
padding-right: 1em;
padding-top: 0;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-css good">/* Recommended */
border-top: 0;
font: 100%/1.6 palatino, georgia, serif;
padding: 0 1em 2em;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="0_and_Units" class="numbered">0 and Units</h4>

<p>Omit unit specification after “0” values, unless required.</p>

<p>Do not use units after <code>0</code> values unless they are required.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css good">flex: 0px; /* This flex-basis component requires a unit. */
flex: 1 1 0px; /* Not ambiguous without the unit, but needed in IE11. */
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Leading_0s" class="numbered">Leading 0s</h4>

<p>Always include leading “0”s in values.</p>

<p>Put <code>0</code>s in front of values or lengths between -1 and 1.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css good">font-size: 0.8em;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Hexadecimal_Notation" class="numbered">Hexadecimal Notation</h4>

<p>Use 3 character hexadecimal notation where possible.</p>

<p>For color values that permit it, 3 character hexadecimal notation is shorter and
more succinct.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css bad">/* Not recommended */
color: #eebbcc;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-css good">/* Recommended */
color: #ebc;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Important_Declarations" class="numbered">Important Declarations</h4>

<p>Avoid using <code>!important</code> declarations.</p>

<p>These declarations break the natural cascade of CSS and make it difficult to
reason about and compose styles. Use
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity">selector specificity</a>
to override properties instead.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css bad">/* Not recommended */
.example {
  font-weight: bold !important;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-css good">/* Recommended */
.example {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Hacks" class="numbered">Hacks</h4>

<p>Avoid user agent detection as well as CSS “hacks”—try a different approach
first.</p>

<p>It’s tempting to address styling differences over user agent detection or
special CSS filters, workarounds, and hacks. Both approaches should be
considered last resort in order to achieve and maintain an efficient and
manageable code base. Put another way, giving detection and hacks a free pass
will hurt projects in the long run as projects tend to take the way of least
resistance. That is, allowing and making it easy to use detection and hacks
means using detection and hacks more frequently—and more frequently is too
frequently.</p>

<h3 id="CSS_Formatting_Rules" class="numbered">CSS Formatting Rules</h3>

<h4 id="Declaration_Order" class="numbered">Declaration Order</h4>

<p>Alphabetize declarations (optional).</p>

<p>Sort declarations consistently within a project. In the absence of tooling to
automate and enforce a consistent sort order, consider putting declarations in
alphabetical order in order to achieve consistent code in a way that is easy to
learn, remember, and manually maintain.</p>

<p>Ignore vendor-specific prefixes for sorting purposes. However, multiple
vendor-specific prefixes for a certain CSS property should be kept sorted (e.g.
-moz prefix comes before -webkit).</p>

<pre><code class="language-css good">background: fuchsia;
border: 1px solid;
-moz-border-radius: 4px;
-webkit-border-radius: 4px;
border-radius: 4px;

<!-- <h2 id="Parting_Words">Parting Words</h2>

<p><em>Be consistent.</em></p>

<p>If you’re editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and
determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators,
you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them,
make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.</p>

<p>The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so
people can concentrate on what you’re saying rather than on how you’re saying
it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local
style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different
from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when
they go to read it. Avoid this.</p> -->
